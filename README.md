# Cross-platform launcher
One script to rule them all.

I created this project to learn the basics of using GitHub.
An idea behind this script is to have a single file that executes in all major operating systems.
Currently, manual modification of the script is needed, to use it as a launcher.
Just replace the placeholder "App" with the name or path of the application where specified.
